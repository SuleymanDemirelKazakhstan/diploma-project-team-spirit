The aim of the project was to develop a user friendly and easy platform that considers pain points and preferences of both customers and second hand shop owners. Also we wanted to innovate the auction system in buying and selling clothes. Realizing that market and user needs and problems will be solved we developed this project. In the future, we believe that with the help of this product we will improve the culture of conscious consumption of clothing, and ease life of second hand shop customers and sellers.
