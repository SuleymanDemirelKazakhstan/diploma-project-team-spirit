\end{center}
The fashion industry is one of the industries that pollute the environment and is in second place in terms of consumption after water. At the moment, many people are striving for a more environmentally friendly approach to clothing and second-hand stores are a good solution. Also, the concept of second-hand and "vintage" clothing is gaining popularity among the young generation, as it allows you to purchase unique items at an affordable price. In Kazakhstan, this activity is carried out through social networks and there is no integrated online platform with online processes, which complicates the search and purchase of things for buyers and sellers. For this reason, we want to demonstrate an alternative for stores, a trading platform with the ability to put unique items up for auction.
