## Alternatives / Market research

<summary>Alternatives on a similar topic. Online used clothing store.</summary>

San Francisco-based [Flyp](https://www.joinflyp.com/) is on a mission to help people achieve “Less clutter. More empowerment.”

The platform connects people with independent professional resellers.

Here’s how it works:

1. Take a picture of each item you want to sell.
2. Pro sellers apply to sell your clothes and you choose your preferred seller based on their price estimates.
3. Flyp gives you a shipping label to send your items to the pro seller.
4. The pro seller posts your items on multiple thrift platforms and after they sell, boom – he/she will send you the profits.

**Advantages**:

1. They accept good-condition (meaning rip, smell, and stain-free) clothes, shoes, and handbags from all kinds of known fashion labels and designer brands.
2. Free Reseller Tools
3. They don’t accept non-branded or fast fashion labels like Forever 21 and H&M.

**Disadvantages**:

1. On par with in-store consignment rates, their **30%-50%** fees are a little steeper than the average **10%-20%** range of other self-selling thrift resale sites. In exchange for those higher fees, they take care of everything for you, including shipping fees, photography, item research, price negotiation, packing and shipping to the buyer.
