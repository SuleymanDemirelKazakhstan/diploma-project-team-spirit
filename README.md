<summary>Alternatives on a similar topic. Online used clothing store.</summary>

San Francisco-based [Flyp](https://www.joinflyp.com/) is on a mission to help people achieve “Less clutter. More empowerment.”

The platform connects people with independent professional resellers.

Here’s how it works:

1. Take a picture of each item you want to sell.
2. Pro sellers apply to sell your clothes and you choose your preferred seller based on their price estimates.
3. Flyp gives you a shipping label to send your items to the pro seller.
4. The pro seller posts your items on multiple thrift platforms and after they sell, boom – he/she will send you the profits.

**Advantages**:

1. They accept good-condition (meaning rip, smell, and stain-free) clothes, shoes, and handbags from all kinds of known fashion labels and designer brands.
2. Free Reseller Tools
3. They don’t accept non-branded or fast fashion labels like Forever 21 and H&M.

**Disadvantages**:

1. On par with in-store consignment rates, their **30%-50%** fees are a little steeper than the average **10%-20%** range of other self-selling thrift resale sites. In exchange for those higher fees, they take care of everything for you, including shipping fees, photography, item research, price negotiation, packing and shipping to the buyer.

## Goals
Our goal is to make life easier for both buyers and sellers of vintage items. We are going to achieve this goal with our project.

What alternatives do the residents of Kazakhstan have at the moment? It's either *Instagram* or *olx.kz*.

Here are a few advantages that we have in comparison with them:
1) We will not have irrelevant products like in Instagram
2) We provide convenience; All the goods will be in one place.
3) Saving time
4) Auction
5) Attracting new customers; For buyers who had a small audience.

## Technologies
In our project we use **Golang or Java**, **ReactJS**, **Figma**, **Miro**, **Photoshop**

## Pages / Activities
There are 3 roles: Customer, Shop, Admin
We will have following pages for customer:
- Main page - (Links to List op shops, catalogue, and auctions of the day)
- Catalogue (all products are here)
- Lists of shops (list of shops which sell products)
- Basket (products added to basket)
- My orders (Active and closed orders of user)
- My profile (Personal information of user)
- About platform (Information about platform)

And for Shop:
- Dashboard

- Product page (Page with product description and characteristics with access to edit and delete)
- Orders (all orders from customers)
- Auction page (all products in action and history for it)
- Shop settings (Shop information with access to edit)

## User Personas
![user persona 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55758989/154852547-7f7ea38c-d063-4964-9088-b97fc5c4fdbc.png)
![user persona 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55758989/154852623-ac68f7ff-3cc2-49e4-8d07-6bb87eb04c01.png)



## User stories
As a Website User, it's vital to see all actual products that are not selled to anyone yet. I want to see all products with necessary information and be able to buy them.
As an Admin, I want to be able to update my shop's catalogue, push products for auction and inform customers.

## Sitemap, Page descriptions
![SiteMap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55758989/154851960-72b3fae1-d513-4038-ba31-f1a9df9870e2.jpg)



## Non-Functional requirements
 - **Usability:** The site should be user-friendly and understandable.
 - **Security:** Only a user with the "site admin" role can assign roles to other users to avoid any data security issues.
 - **Data integrity:** The system must keep backup copies of data so that it can be restored.

## Risks
 - To create a site, there may not be enough specialists, since it takes a lot of effort to build an auction.
 - Due to the large number of users using the auction, the site may collapse a bit.
 - When creating this site, we may lack the skills to integrate the creation of a payment system.
 - Due to the large number of people using Olx.kz and Instagram, our project may not gain momentum.

## Future iterations
During the project, we will use Agile, we will make plans and analyze the project. In the implementation of the project, if there are some points that we have not taken into account, we will return to tasks in order to make the project better. And every time we will test.
