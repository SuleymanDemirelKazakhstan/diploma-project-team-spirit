* Added interfaces for greater abstraction, in this way we would reduce the dependence of the levels on each other
* Added the ability to save and delete photos
  * I tried to convert images to binary code, but converting an image to a large binary object and storing it in a database is quite a long process, and sometimes it can cause problems. The easiest way is to save the image on the server (or in a local directory) and save the path to the image in the database. So we can access the image using the path to the image in the database.
