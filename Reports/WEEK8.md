* This week I built basic UI kit to make future design consistent and easier to construct. UI kit is the collection of basic UI elements such as font, color, icons and illustrations, buttons, textfields and etc.
* Also I started making wireframes for authrorization using data from Information Architecture that I constructed last weeks.
